# website2-bigfiles

This repository is meant for storing large files which are included in the ironArray website such as videos. Therefore, this is meant to be a submodule of [website2](https://github.com/ironArray/website2). Right now there is only one folder `videos`, but as this repository grows the structure of its content may change. Keep in mind that probably any change on the structure of this repository will affect the [website2](https://github.com/ironArray/website2) doc links.
